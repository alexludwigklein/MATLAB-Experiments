# MATLAB-Experiments
Collection of files and classes describing the outcome of an experiment with support for many MATLAB's builtin 
data types as well as custom classes, e.g. [Videos](https://github.com/alexludwigklein/MATLAB-Videos) and [BeamProfiles](https://github.com/alexludwigklein/MATLAB-BeamProfiles).
The purpose of the classes is to make all information of an experiment available in MATLAB, i.e. the control
parameters of the experiment, the raw data (such as high-speed movies) and the results of the post processing.

## Installation
Add the parent directory that holds all @-folders to you local MATLAB path. This task can easily be done
	with MATLAB's `addpath` and `genpath` functions. The code requires the following toolboxes to be installed 
	(depending on the features used in the [Videos](https://github.com/alexludwigklein/MATLAB-Videos) class):

* Optimization Toolbox
* Signal Processing Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* Curve Fitting Toolbox
* Computer Vision System Toolbox
	
Furthermore, the code makes use of some additional third party tools that can be found on the [file exchange](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange) or on [GitHub](https://github.com) (again, mostly for the support of the [Videos](https://github.com/alexludwigklein/MATLAB-Videos) and [BeamProfiles](https://github.com/alexludwigklein/MATLAB-BeamProfiles) class) ):

* [TIFFSTack](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32025-dylanmuir-tiffstack) for reading and mapping TIF files to memory
* [DataHash](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31272-datahash) for creating hash values
* [GetFullPath](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28249-getfullpath) that should be available as `fullpath` on your MATLAB path to determine the full path of a file
* [saveastiff](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35684-save-and-load-a-multiframe-tiff-image) for saving TIF files
* [export_fig](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) for exporting MATLAB figures in high resolution (used when exporting videos as shown on screen)
* [SLM Tools](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24443-slm-shape-language-modeling) for Shape Language Modeling (SLM)
